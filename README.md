# CMOS_Characterization

This repository contains the code necessary to calculate FPN (Fixed Pattern Noise) and PRNU (Photo-Response Non-Uniformity) for a CMOS imaging sensor. The code is intended to be used for CMOS characterization tests, and it is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook (for the ease of running it in small pieces). 

Questions regarding this analysis program may be directed to srodawac@gmail.com.
